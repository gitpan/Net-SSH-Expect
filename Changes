Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSH::Expect.

1.00 2007/08/02
	- Implementing a total new API. Many old methods dissapeared and new methods appeared.
	Some methods were kept but were rewritten.
	This was to make the module more flexible and open to a broader range of usages as people
	on the internet required.

0.07 2007/07/06
	- fixed the bug to set the remote prompt in the connect() method by putting the pattern
	[\s\S]+ in the expect that swallows the remote prompt
		while ($ssh->expect($timeout, '-re', qr/[\s\S]+/s)){
				# First we swallow any output the SSH server put on the tty after the logon. This is
				# usually the original remote prompt that we want to substitute.
		}

	- added the new constructor options that configure the Expect object:
	exp_internal debug

	- removed the 'verbose' attribute replacing it by two more specific attributes
	verbose_ssh and log_stdout
